* Replace current Makefiles with an autoconf setup (maybe use
  automake?) (Do we even need this?)

  This would probably be useful for getting people on other distributions
  and operating systems going with fortune.

* Split-off properly offensive fortune file generation (and provide a
  fake offensive fortune for when it's not installed)

* .fortunerc and /etc/fortunerc support

* More fortunes!

* Properly format all fortunes! (See notes for details)

* Localised -a and -o fortune display

  This can be mixed in with the configuration support. In addition, it'd be nice
  to be able to have more than one language and so on.

  At the moment, I (pasc) am working on re-doing the datfile finding code. This
  would fix a number of small bugs that people have found over the years, and
  should make it easier to select which sets of fortune you want to display.
