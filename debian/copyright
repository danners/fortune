Notes for the Debian GNU/Linux port of BSD fortune(6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original author is Ken Arnold.
The Linux port of the fortune package (from NetBSD-current in April 1995)
was done by Florian LaRoche <florian@jurix.jura.uni-sb.de>
Amy A. Lewis <alewis@email.unc.edu> modified the sources (and the fortune
files) heavily, fixing bugs and adding new functionality in Oct 1995
The data file "cookie" is from Karl Lehenbauer's postings to alt.sources.
The Debian packaging was done by Helmut Geyer
 <Helmut.Geyer@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>, and later maintained by Brian Bassett
 <brian@butterfly.ml.org>, then by Mark Ng <ng@debian.org>, based on
 the Debian fortune package done by David H. Silber <dhs@firefly.com>
 from sources obtained from
 ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/amusements/fortune-mod-9708.tar.gz
